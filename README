# Purpose: 
find the source that is being applied to the ADC (Voltage/Current). This is becuase the ADC scales down the reading of the voltage and current, for voltage the range is 0-5 V, and we need to find the scale factor to scale back to the source being applied.

## Strarting out:
1. 
the user will be promted to input a int (1 = Voltage, 2 = Current, and 3 = rate of ADC)

1.1/1.2 
  The user will be promted to enter the source being applied a total of 4 time, which is defined as NUM_SCALE_SAMPLES
  The average scale factor will be printed on the screen
1.3 
Rate will spit out how many samples the ADC can read in a second

### This is not perfect nor complete. We could use the battery's performance chart to find when the battery should read 0% and 100% to prevent the death of the battery.
