I have the Moving Average with a queue working and I get "OK" for all test cases until it reaches the end, then I get "ERROR". This is because I dont not have an init method to reinitialize the queue in after the code is ran. Once and if i need to do that, i can create a method that init the queue when prometed to in the void loop void. this would allow the MA to constanly be updated.
